# The stuff
So this is supposed to be a speech recognition software made from scratch withouth using stuff like `speechRecognition`, this is due Friday, 24.

## So far
* Made a working simple GUI for interaction
* The GUI is able to record audio and store into a `.wav` file
* The audio can be processed by python 
* Implemented a low pass filter for the recorded audio to eliminate unwanted frequencies

## TODO
* Clean up the code in recognition
* Check for a good cutoff frequency
* Be able to actually recognize words or at least letters
